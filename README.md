# cftsolver - A Classical Field Theory Solver

We can solve Quantum Field Theory (QFT) by doing quantum mechanics - computing the S-matrix from the path integral, a sort of overlap integral between two definite states.
What about solving the underlying classical field theory before quantizing? This tool aims to visualize interacting theories by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion (EoM) explicitly for a set of input field configurations. This is effectively a system of coupled partial differential equations on a lattice. We will first start by investigating free field theories and then graduate to interacting ones, like scalar QED.

### TODO
* implement field classes
* euler lagrange equations of motion: scalar QED + gauge fixing
* add modules for 1-D and 2-D solvers
* test OpenGL

Long term:
* test scattering
* test decays
* make interactive in web browser embedding
